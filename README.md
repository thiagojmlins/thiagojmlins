My name is Thiago, and I'm a self-taught full-stack developer.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about design patterns, clean code and front-end development (React fans, assemble!)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on backend projects (Node.js, Python and try to learn some Golang as well) 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with test-driven development and code optimization
- 📫 How to reach me: thiagojmlins.github.io (soon)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/ele
